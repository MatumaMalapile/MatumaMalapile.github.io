                <h1>My Name is Matuma Sophia Malapile</h1>
                <p>
                    I am an Application Development student at CPUT with three years of coding 
                    experience. I work comfortably with Java, Python, and beginner-level JavaScript, and I 
                    hold a Higher Certificate in ICT (Application Development) as well as a Technical 
                    Software Development certificate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have completed projects such as an e-commerce desktop app, a student 
                    enrollment management system, and a UI redesign of the Apple Books App in 
                    Figma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about software development, user-centered design, and building 
                    professional web templates and websites.

                <h2>My Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    My mission is to grow into a skilled and impactful Software Developer who builds 
                    solutions that are functional, user-focused, and meaningful. I aim to master languages 
                    like Java, Python, and modern web technologies while expanding my knowledge of design 
                    and full-stack development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, create clean and 
                    intuitive digital experiences, and contribute to innovative projects. Whether it's building 
                    applications, designing professional web templates, or building websites for individuals 
                    and companies, I want everything I create to be reliable, modern, and crafted with purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Driven by curiosity, resilience, and a passion for learning, I strive to grow with every 
                    project I take on and to build a career that reflects my values—creativity, and continuous 
                    improvement.

                <h2>What Drives Me:</h2>
                <p>
                    What drives me is the desire to create technology that makes people's lives easier, more 
                    connected, and more enjoyable. I am motivated by the idea of making an impact—whether 
                    through clean code, thoughtful design, or building intuitive user experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am driven by continuous learning. Every new language, every bug solved, and every project 
                    completed pushes me to grow and become a better developer. Coming from a small village in 
                    Limpopo and now studying software development in Cape Town has taught me resilience, focus, 
                    and the importance of building my future with intention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about contributing to meaningful projects, improving my craft, and using my 
                    skills to help others—whether through full applications, professional websites that empower 
                    individuals and businesses. My drive comes from knowing that with every line of code, I am 
                    shaping my career, my impact, and the opportunities ahead of me.
